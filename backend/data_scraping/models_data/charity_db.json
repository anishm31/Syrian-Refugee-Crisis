We encourage everyone to respond to humanitarian disasters, to promote integral human development and to advocate on the causes of poverty and violence. We animate Catholic communities and all people of good will in solidarity with the suffering of their brothers and sisters around the world.\n\n**Emergency response**\n\nCaritas responds practically to humanitarian crises such as natural disasters, conflict and the effects of climate change. We save lives, relieve suffering and help rebuild livelihoods and communities in the longer-term. This allows women and men in the poorest and most vulnerable communities to survive and recover from crises and to live in a safe and secure environment.\n\n**Transforming lives**\n\nCaritas promotes integral human development so that people in the worst off and most disadvantaged communities are free to flourish and live in peace and dignity. We work to ensure that our natural environment is managed responsibly and sustainably in the interests of the entire human family.\n\n**Calling for a better world**\n\nCaritas seeks a world where the voices of the poor are heard and acted upon. This is a world where women and men in the poorest and most disadvantaged communities are able to influence the systems, decisions and resources that affect them. They can then live under governments, institutions and global structures that are just and accountable.",

Since then, we have expanded in size to reach more than 130 million people in more than 100 countries on five continents.\n\nFor over 75 years, our mission has been to assist impoverished and disadvantaged people overseas, working in the spirit of Catholic social teaching to promote the sacredness of human life and the dignity of the human person. Although our mission is rooted in the Catholic faith, our operations serve people based solely on need, regardless of their race, religion or ethnicity. Within the United States, CRS engages Catholics to live their faith in solidarity with the poor and suffering people of the world.\n\nCRS is motivated by the example of Jesus Christ to ease suffering, provide development assistance, and foster charity and justice. We are committed to a set of Guiding Principles and hold ourselves accountable to each other for them.\n\nWatch what happens when little miracles touch the lives of the most vulnerable people around the world. Witness the lifesaving help and hope provided by Catholic Relief Services. Take a look at just how far your heart can reach.\n\nAs the official international humanitarian agency of the Catholic community in the United States, CRS is governed by a board of directors comprising clergy, most of them bishops elected by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, as well as religious and Catholic lay men and women.",

Originally called the League of Red Cross Societies, we were the brainchild of Henry Davison, the president of the American Red Cross War Committee.\n\nDavison convened the League\u2019s founding members\u2014the Red Cross Societies of France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan and the United States\u2014at an international medical conference. Together, they believed the compassion and expertise shown by Red Cross volunteers during wartime could be shown in peacetime too.\n\nThe League\u2019s first objective was simple: improve the health of people in countries that had suffered greatly during the war. It also sought to improve existing Red Cross Societies and promote the creation of new ones around the world.\n\nWithin months of its creation, the League had launched a campaign to counter a massive typhus epidemic in Eastern Europe. Shortly after, it launched appeals in the wake of the Russian famine of 1921 and the Great Kanto earthquake in Japan in 1923.\n\nIn 1983, it became the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and finally\u2014in 1991\u2014the IFRC as we are today.",

We started our relief efforts after World War Two. Today, we work in both new and protracted crises across 40 countries. We specialise in six areas: food security, education, shelter, legal assistance, protection from violence, and water, sanitation and hygiene.\n\nWe stand up for people forced to flee. NRC is a determined advocate for displaced people. We promote and defend displaced people's rights and dignity in local communities, with national governments and in the international arena. NRC\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country.\n\nWe work with partners across the world through NORCAP, our global provider of humanitarian, development and peacebuilding expertise. NORCAP collaborates with local, national and international partners on finding sustainable solutions to meet the needs of people at risk.\n\nAround 15,000 humanitarians work with the Norwegian Refugee Council. Most of us are hired locally to work in the field, and a small number are based at our head office in Oslo. Many of our colleagues were once themselves forced to flee their homes.\n\nToday, a record 100 million people are fleeing war and persecution. Not since World War Two have more people needed our help. The Norwegian Refugee Council assisted almost 10 million people worldwide in 2022, and with your support, we can help even more.",

Together, we deliver grassroots programmes, provide emergency relief and campaign for things such as women\u2019s economic rights, tax justice and climate justice.\n\nOur work falls into four broad areas: [women](https://actionaid.org/taxonomy/term/71), [politics and economics](https://actionaid.org/taxonomy/term/3), [land and climate](https://actionaid.org/taxonomy/term/2), and [emergencies](https://actionaid.org/taxonomy/term/70). We have a particular focus on women\u2019s rights; it\u2019s a thread that runs through all our work.\n\nActionAid was founded as a charity in 1972. In the 1990s, we adopted a human rights-based approach to development. In 2003, we established the ActionAid International federation. Our head office is in Johannesburg, South Africa. We also have hubs in Asia, the Americas and Europe.",

Many did not survive the journey; they were killed by pirates or drowned because of storms and rough seas. Fr Arrupe felt compelled to act. He called on the Jesuits \u201cto bring at least some relief to such a tragic situation\u201d.\n\nFr Arrupe wrote to over 50 Jesuit provinces regarding the situation, recognising that the Jesuits, then numbering 27,000 men across the world, were well-placed to coordinate a global humanitarian response. As conflicts broke out in Central and Latin America, southeastern Europe, and across Africa, JRS rapidly grew from helping Vietnamese boat people in a few camps in Southeast Asia to working with refugees around the world.\n\nNearly 20 years after our founding, JRS was officially registered as a foundation of the Vatican City State on 19 March 2000.",
